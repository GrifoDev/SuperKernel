config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	help
	  CPU Frequency scaling allows you to change the clock speed of 
	  CPUs on the fly. This is a nice method to save power, because 
	  the lower the CPU clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU
	  clock speed, you need to either enable a dynamic cpufreq governor
	  (see below) after boot, or use a userspace tool.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq>.

	help
	  'interextrem' - This driver adds a dynamic cpufreq policy governor
	  designed for latency-sensitive workloads.

	  This governor attempts to reduce the latency of clock
	  increases so that the system is more responsive to
	  interactive workloads.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called cpufreq_interextrem.

	  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpu-freq.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	help
	  This adds a generic DT based cpufreq driver for frequency management.
	  It supports both uniprocessor (UP) and symmetric multiprocessor (SMP)
	  systems which share clock and voltage across all CPUs.

	  This adds the cpufreq driver for SuperH. Any CPU that supports
	  clock rate rounding through the clock framework can use this
	  driver. While it will make the kernel slightly larger, this is

	  will also generate a notice in the boot log before disabling
	  itself if the CPU in question is not capable of rate rounding.
